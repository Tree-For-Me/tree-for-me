We will use Watson Discovery and Watson Assistant to build an app to find a compatible plant for your room conditions. Tree for Me is a plant finder designed to find the perfect plant for your wants, needs, and environmental conditions. It will gather information from the user including (but not limited to): light conditions, indoor/outdoor placement, size, maintenance, temperature, and fruit-bearing capacity and report a list of suitable plants for the given input.
